## Intro

A fragment is an Android component that holds part of the behavior and/or UI of an activity. As the name would suggest, fragments are not independent entities, but are tied to a single activity. In many ways, they have functionality similar to activities.

Fragments provides:

- `Modularity`: Dividing complex activity code across fragments for better organization and maintenance.
- `Reusability`: Placing behavior or UI parts into fragments that multiple activities can share.
- `Adaptability`: Representing sections of a UI as different fragments and utilizing different layouts depending on screen orientation and size.
